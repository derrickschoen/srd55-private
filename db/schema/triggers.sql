-- Browser-product invariants that Drizzle cannot represent.
--
-- These are NOT Laravel parity: they enforce, at the storage layer, that a
-- spell slot never holds both a fixed grant and a user selection. The named
-- CHECK constraint on spell_selection_slots covers INSERT/UPDATE of NULLs;
-- these triggers produce the specific error message the product surfaces.
--
-- This file is appended verbatim as the postlude of the generated schema by
-- scripts/compose-schema.ts.
